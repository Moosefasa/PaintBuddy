# PaintBuddy
A simple, quick calculator that estimates floor area to wall area with a positive variance.  
This calculator uses a simple formula to calculate wall area of your interior based solely on total square footage of the location, amount of rooms, and average ceiling height.
This is a quick calculator and is NOT going to provide a perfectly accurate measurement, though it will overestimate wall area and paint needs to ensure you'd have enough for your project.
The texture slider adjusts coverage needs from 250ft^2 to 350ft^2 based on texture of the surface.  This will not adjust the wall area, but will adjust the amount of paint needed.

More features will be added in the future.
